This console application is a simple inventory tracking system for milk/formula for young children.  <br><br>

The application writes to a JSON file which will begin with an inventory of zero, upon your first running of the app.  If you have an existing inventory, you can simply add your existing inventory through Option 3 "Add to Freezer".  If you are testing, you will find best results by adding an amount to inventory prior to testing.  I would begin with 1000mL, or more, and keep your testing to a positive number.  We did not limit to only positive values as real life use could result in depletion of inventory and therefore a negative value in inventory.<br><br>

Within the application you can:<br>
Check your inventory; Enter a feeding; and, Add to Freezer (Inventory).  These actions are all in milliliters.  You will also find options to convert your total (in milliliters) to Ounces.<br><br>

The features included in the application are:<br>
-A "Master Loop" is in place for user selection.  Option 5 will allow you to exit the loop/application.<br>
-Data is written and read to a JSON file.  That data is used in the application.<br>
-A conversion tool has been built that converts mL to Ounces<br>
-There have been multiple unit tests created<br><br>

The csv file in the Repository is not currently in use.<br><br><br><br>
